A subclass of MaybeNumber.

What it does that's extra:
    BIG DIFFERENCE: it's hooked up to a trie so it can see if something is a word or not.
        At the moment, I only have this to look for month names but could be expanded to look for other words.

    Additional functionality:
        isdate(): checks if there is a date inside the string somewhere.  Returns bool.
        convert_date(): Parses and converts string dates to datetime class
                        Works for "1/1/2020", "1.1.2020", "1-1-2020", "1 1 2020", etc.
                        Also for "Dec. 31st, 2020" and "the 13th day of November in the year 2020"
        better token splitting: Splits by the token given in __init__.  However, if a date is detected,
                                the date will be kept as a single unit rather than being split up by the token.
                                This allows you to split by space, but still keep the dates together for conversion.

                    Example: "Sally bought the property on this 11th day of August, 2021"
                            Will be split into:
                                ["Sally", "bought", "the", "property", "on", "this",
                                 "11th day of August, 2021"]
                            That will give you the ability to convert the final date into a datetime obj.

Known issues:
    - Did not write this one in C++
    - Gets confused when someone is named April or June or any other month name.
    - There are issues when there are two extended word-dates in a row.  Sometimes, chooses day/year for wrong month.
    - Requires a 4 digit year (I did that deliberately but have not decided if I am happy with that.)

    # the start and end parameters to the _is_valid_date_comprehensive method to see how to slice my date numbers.
    # start = starting index
    # end = exclusive ending index
    #
    # For the informational bitmasks, I will create a new mask to hide whichever bits I don't care about at the moment.
    # The most confusing part of all this is the fact that these bitmasks, unlike most of the others in this class,
    # actually do go forward (not backward).  So start cancels off the MSBs and end cancels of the LSBs.
    #
    # My informational bitmasks contain the following:
    #    is_over_12: if a number is larger than 12, it cannot possibly be the month
    #    is_zero: For a series of numbers to be a date, no number can be zero
    #    is_over_31: If a number is larger than 31, it must be a year
    #    is_four_digits: I added this one to just make the year clearer and to establish that I'm not going to be
    #                    messing around with the possibility that 29 is the year not the day because it's February
    #                    or anything like that.  I'm keeping this on a somewhat simpler level.
    #
    # Using these, I should be able to get an estimate of generally where the day and month are -- and to cancel out
    # obviously incorrect dates.  I'll detail some of that below:
    #
    #   ESTABLISHING THE MONTH:
    #      If the month is a word, this section is skipped.
    #
    #      'could_be_month' is a variable that represents any indices that feasibly could be the month.
    #      It's derived by seeing which of the three bits in is_over_12 is turned off.
    #          > Computing the date:
    #                The trick is to see if only 1 bit is on in could_be_month
    #                If 2 bits are on, then we have a situation where we have 2 numbers below 12 and don't know which
    #                 is the month and which is the day.
    #          > Invalidity check:
    #                If no bits are on (i.e. all numbers are > 12), then this is not a date.
    #                Alternate check: determine if is_over_12 is kinda like 0b111 but shifted over << a smidge
    #
    #   ESTABLISHING THE DAY:
    #       In cases where the day is over 12 but under 31, we must extract the day's index from the bitmask.
    #         We have is_over_31, which turns bits on if the index CANNOT be a day.
    #         We have is_over_12, which turns bits on if the index is EITHER a day or a year.
    #         We do not want to flip the month bit back on.
    #
    #       > Computing the date:
    #           What I needed was a way to cancel the bit that is_over_31 has in common with is_over_12, but without
    #           turning back on the month bit.
    #           Therefore, I decided to do is_over_31 ^ is_over_12 to cancel off the two set bits.
    #           Then, I & the result with is_over_12, which will turn that month bit back to 0.
    #               # Example: 12/15/2001 is 0b011 for is_over_12 and 0b001 for is_over_31:
    #               #           0b011 ^ 0b001 = 0b110
    #               #           0b110 & 0b011 = 0b010 which gives 15 as the day which is the correct answer
    #           If this procedure results in 0b0, then there are two numbers that are less than 12 and we have to
    #           guess which is the month and which is the day.
    #
    #       > Invalidity Check:
    #            If the above procedure results in 2 bits that are turned on (instead of one bit), then it's not a date.
    #
    # There are a few other validity checks, which I get into in the method itself.
    #
    # However, beyond the basic validity checks, we really do need to parse the date to determine its validity.  So
    # this can't be quite as nice as with isnumber, where we can use bitmasks to instantly know if it's a number
    # without ever having to compute what the value might be.  For languages with compilers (not Python), having a
    # compile-time check rather than a try/except runtime check is extremely desirable.
    #
    # But for dates, the numbers all depend on one another.  To determine if the day is valid, we must know the month.
    # To determine if February 29 is valid, we must know the year.  Therefore, we have to parse the entire date.
    #
    # As a result, I decided to play a cute little Python trick and -- instead of returning a boolean -- if it is
    # a date, I return the datetime object itself.  Since __bool__ is true on that object, it still casts correctly.
